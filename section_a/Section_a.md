### A p**ositive note**

Excellent work Student on the python task for OOP - Classes. You have shown a good understand here. Your task was excellent. Keep working hard and keep up the good work Student. Looking forward to your next submission.

### Correctness:

The code appears to be correct as it solves the problem of grouping anagrams together. The solution works by using a dictionary to store the anagrams as keys and their corresponding words as values. The characters in each string are sorted, and the resulting sorted string is used as a key to group the anagrams together.

### Efficiency:

The code is efficient as it uses a dictionary to group anagrams together. It sorts each string in the input list, which takes some time, and then performs a dictionary lookup, which is fast. The amount of memory used by the algorithm is proportional to the size of the input list, which is reasonable.

### Style:

The code follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python with consistent indentation and variable naming. However, there is an issue with the indentation of the **`def groupAnagrams(self, strs):`**
 line, which should be indented. Also, there should be a space after the comma in the **`print`**
 statement.

### Documentation:

The code has no documentation, but the variable names are descriptive enough to understand what is happening. However, it would be helpful to add a docstring to the **`groupAnagrams`**
method to explain what the method does, what the input and output are, and how the algorithm works.

I mentioned “docstrings” [Python Docstrings - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/) here’s a quick read about docstings. 
I think you're be interested in learning about docstrings in programming.
